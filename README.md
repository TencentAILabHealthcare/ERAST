### This is a collection of training code for ERAST(Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Search Tool). 
ERAST is a novel solution designed to handle approximately 1 billion biological sequences within the largest vector database. 
ERAST combines cutting-edge large language models and vector database technology to provide efficient and precise searches for homologous biological sequences. 
It enhances search quality by integrating pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimization stages, overcoming the key limitations of existing methods.ERAST conducts accurate searches against billions of biological sequences in mere milliseconds. 
In summary, ERAST represents a significant advancement in computational biology, providing researchers with an invaluable tool for fast, accurate homology searches across large-scale biological databases. The vector database integrated with ERAST can be accessed at https://ai4s.tencent.com/erast.
