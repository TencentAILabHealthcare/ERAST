This is a repertoire of ERAST(Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Search Tool) training code. ERAST is a novel solution designed to handle approximately 1 billion biological sequences within the largest vector database to date.  ERAST combines cutting-edge large language models and vector database technology to provide both efficient and precise searches for homologous biological sequences.It enhances search quality by integrating pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimization stages, overcoming the key limitations of existing methods.ERAST conducts accurate searches against billions of biological sequences in mere milliseconds. In summary, ERAST represents a significant advancement in computational biology, providing researchers with an invaluable tool for fast, accurate homology searches across large-scale biological databases.
