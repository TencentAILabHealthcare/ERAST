### This is a collection of training code for ERAST(Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Search Tool). 
Homology search plays a fundamental role in computational biology, enabling the identification of evolutionary relationships and functional similarities among biological sequences. However, current homology search methods, including BLAST, Foldseek, and MMseqs2, often struggle to efficiently and accurately process the vast scale of biological databases. To address these limitations, we introduce ERAST (Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Search Tool), a novel solution designed to handle approximately 1 billion biological sequences within the largest vector database to date. ERAST combines cutting-edge large language models and vector database technology to provide both efficient and precise searches for homologous biological sequences. It enhances search quality by integrating pre-retrieval, retrieval, and post-retrieval optimization stages, overcoming the key limitations of existing methods. Importantly, ERAST equally supports both nucleotide and protein sequences, expanding its utility beyond the protein-centric approaches of current tools. Through advanced indexing techniques, fine-grained segmentation, and metadata integration, ERAST enables rapid, high-precision searches across extensive databases. For instance, ERAST outperforms Foldseek-TM by being 59 times faster, while also improving mean average precision (MAP) by 38%. Moreover, the no-re-ranker version of ERAST is 5 times more accurate than MMseqs2, while operating 9 times faster. This performance allows ERAST to conduct accurate searches against billions of biological sequences in mere milliseconds. In summary, ERAST represents a significant advancement in computational biology, providing researchers with an invaluable tool for fast, accurate homology searches across large-scale biological databases.
